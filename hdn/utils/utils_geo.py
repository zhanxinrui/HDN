#      b) mask_match: array of N elements, every element of which is set to 0 for outliers and to 1 for the other points (computed only in the RANSAC and LMedS methods)
# N.B.1: trc is estimated up to scale (i.e. the algorithm always returns ||trc||=1, we need a scale in order to recover a translation which is coherent with previous estimated poses)
# N.B.2: this function has problems in the following cases: [see Hartley/Zisserman Book]
# - 'geometrical degenerate correspondences', e.g. all the observed features lie on a plane (the correct model for the correspondences is an homography) or lie a ruled quadric
# - degenerate motions such a pure rotation (a sufficient parallax is required) or an infinitesimal viewpoint change (where the translation is almost zero)
# N.B.3: the five-point algorithm (used for estimating the Essential Matrix) seems to work well in the degenerate planar cases [Five-Point Motion Estimation Made Easy, Hartley]
# N.B.4: as reported above, in case of pure rotation, this algorithm will compute a useless fundamental matrix which cannot be decomposed to return a correct rotation
